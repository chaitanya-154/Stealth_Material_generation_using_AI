Sure, here are some materials related to stealth:

* **Radar-absorbent materials (RAMs)**: These materials are designed to absorb radar waves, making it difficult for radar systems to detect objects made of these materials. Some common RAMs include carbon-based materials, such as graphene and carbon nanotubes, as well as metals such as bismuth and lead.
* **Shaped surfaces:** The shape of an object can also affect its radar cross-section (RCS). Objects with sharp edges and corners reflect radar waves more than objects with smooth, rounded surfaces. This is why stealth aircraft often have a smooth, angular shape.
* **Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding:** EMI shielding materials are designed to block electromagnetic waves. This can be used to protect sensitive electronic equipment from radar signals, or to make an object less visible to radar by absorbing or reflecting radar waves. Some common EMI shielding materials include metals such as copper and aluminum, as well as plastics and composites.
* **Thermal management:** The heat signature of an object can also be used to detect it. Stealth objects are often designed to dissipate heat quickly, making them less visible to thermal imaging systems. This can be achieved through the use of materials with high thermal conductivity, such as metals, or through the use of vents and other cooling systems.

These are just a few of the materials and techniques that are used to achieve stealth. The specific materials and techniques that are used will vary depending on the application
