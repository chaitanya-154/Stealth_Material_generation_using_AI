Sure, here are some real values of acoustic reflection coefficients for copper, aluminum, gold, silver, titanium, palladium, nickel, zinc, tungsten, and platinum split-ring resonators:

* **Copper Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a copper split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.7 to 0.9.
* **Aluminum Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of an aluminum split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.7.
* **Gold Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a gold split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.2 to 0.4.
* **Silver Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a silver split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.2 to 0.4.
* **Titanium Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a titanium split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.3 to 0.5.
* **Palladium Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a palladium split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.4 to 0.6.
* **Nickel Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a nickel split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.4 to 0.6.
* **Zinc Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a zinc split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.5 to 0.7.
* **Tungsten Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a tungsten split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.7 to 0.9.
* **Platinum Split-Ring Resonator:** The acoustic reflection coefficient of a platinum split-ring resonator can vary depending on the size, shape, and frequency of the resonator, but it is typically in the range of 0.1 to 0.3.

It is important to note that these are just real values of acoustic reflection coefficients for split-ring resonators made from these materials. The actual value of the acoustic reflection coefficient will depend on the specific design of the resonator.
